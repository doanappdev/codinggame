# codinggame
This repo is for my solutions for problems on codinggame.com
I hope it will be helpful for people learning to program.

If you have suggestions on how to improve some of the answers
email me at doanappdev@gmail.com.

codinggame has the option of using an external editor,
I recommend using this feature, you can download/copy the
code to your choice of texteditor or IDE.

I use vim or Sublime Text3 when developing the solutions. 
I would also recommend redirecting the input from text files
into your solutions from the command line for example use the following
command: java Solution < input.txt
